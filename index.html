                    The time value of money (TVM) surmises that money is worth more now than at a future date based on
                    its earning potential. Because money can grow when invested, any delay is a lost opportunity for
                    growth. The time value of money is a core financial principle known as the present discounted value.

                <p>
                    The term balance sheet refers to a financial statement that reports a company's assets, liabilities,
                    and shareholder equity at a specific point in time. Balance sheets provide the basis for computing
                    rates of return for investors and evaluating a company's capital structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In short, the balance sheet is a financial statement that provides a snapshot of what a company owns
                    and owes, as well as the amount invested by shareholders. Balance sheets can be used with other
                    important financial statements to conduct fundamental analysis or calculate financial ratios.

                    Financial Markets include any place or system that provides buyers and sellers the means to trade
                    financial instruments, including bonds, equities, the various international currencies, and
                    derivatives. Financial markets facilitate the interaction between those who need capital with those
                    who have capital to invest. In addition to making it possible to raise capital, financial markets
                    allow participants to transfer risk (generally through derivatives) and promote commerce.
